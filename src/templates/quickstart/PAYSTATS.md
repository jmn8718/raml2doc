Start making a quick test over "PayStats" API using our Console. Take into account that you need to:
  - Be registered and logged-in.
  - Verify you have an application linked to "PayStats" API.

Once you have done that, just go to the Console and select the API and APP you will use for the test. Check that: 
  - "PayStats" is a 2 legged OAuth API, so the Authorization Grant option must be switched to "Client Credentials"
  - The domain combo must be switched to apis.bbva.com.
